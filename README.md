# Lossless Monochromatic Image Compression Algorithms

For more information about the project please read Paper.pdf.

# Breaf file description:

file.py - Includes methods BZIP2, DEFLATE e LZMA.
rle.py - Includes o RLE.
sais.py - Includes the necessary functions to create the suffix array.
metodo.py - Final original method created.
TP2_enuciado.pdf - pointers to the creation of the project.


In the top of the files there are some variables defined:
source_file -> File name to compress/decompress
extension -> Final extension of compressed file
destination_file -> Name of compressed file


To test the BZIP2, DEFLATE e LZMA you onlyneed o run the file.py file, and choose the method in question.
To test the RLE, run rle.py.
To test the original method created run metodo.py.

Extra: the images must be in the same folder as the .py files.
